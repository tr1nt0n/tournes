herbe des tournes: Saintonge name for tourmentine, a plant of unknown appearance which makes those who step on it lose their sense of direction or retrace their own steps. At night it spreads a phosphorescent light like that of certain glowworms. Its spell can be broken by turning one's clothing inside out. Around Moncontour in Brittany, tourmentine further has the power to make people understand the language of animals but only as long as the one who has touched or taken it isn't aware that the plant in question is in fact tourmentine.

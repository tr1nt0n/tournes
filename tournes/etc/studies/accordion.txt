- Ensemble uses button accordion 
- glissandi are possible of approximately a semitone, works about the same as a keyboard accordion
- don't forget about beating: bend one note, leave one note stable ( also effective with chords )
- bisbigliando can be just as effective with chords, not just single notes
- bellow-shake tremolo potentially useful ( could be rhythmed )
- register key clicks to cut off moments? Could be kitschy
- continuous pitchless swipes of the buttons could be useful ( only when used to create these continuous texture clouds. Not valuable as more rhythmic material )
